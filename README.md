# Prediction of Signal Lost due to Rainfall at User Cellular Signal Reception.

### Project Idea 

The Cellular Signals are affected by so many factors like temperature, rain, fog, wind,
etc. As water is a good conductor of heat and electricity, when a rainfall starts the water droplets
absorb the energy of radio signals and turn them into heat which leads to degradation of strength
of radio signal. The radio signal which travels during rainfall may get reflected, refracted and
scattered which can cause signal to get lost, deviate and drop the call. As this is the main
scenario at cellular signals, how about prediction of signal loss/ drop due to rain. To predict the
signal loss we need a dataset of rainfall reading and signal loss/drop reading for certain periods
of time at all rain conditions and ideal condition of no rainfall. By this, we can visualize the
loss/drop of signal at various conditions. To predict the future signal loss we need to build an
algorithm by using ML algorithm techniques, which predict the signal loss in all and no rainfall
conditions like light/medium/heavy/no rainfall. By using the no rainfall condition as ideal
condition we can estimate how much signal got lost/dropped.
